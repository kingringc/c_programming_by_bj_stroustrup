# To compile the program/source code using clang++ or g++ or c++
* c++11
```command: clang++ inputFile.cpp -o outputFilename -std=c++11```

* c++14
```command: clang++ inputFile.cpp -o outputFilename -std=c++14```

# Take aways
* cout is character output stream.
* cin is character input stream.
* Header contains definitions of terms such as cout.
* // is a double slash, Anything written after this token // considered as a comment. Comments are ignored by compiler, and written for the benefit of programmers who read the code. Comments are written to describe what the program is intended to do and in general to provide information useful for humans that can't be directly expressed in code.
* << is a output operator 'put-into' std cout to display value in monitor or console.
* << is a input operator 'get-from' specifies where the input goes.
* Compiler translates human redable code or source code in to executable or object code or machine code which machine/computer can understand.
* Errors found by compiler are compile-time error.
* cout refers to a standard output stream. cout is a abbrevation of 'Character Ouput Stream'.
* function is a named sequence of instructions for the computer to execute in order which they are written. unction has fours parts as follows, return type, name, paramter list enclosed in parentheses ( ), function body enclosed with in pair of curly braces { }.
* A file included using #include with suffix .h is called header file, header file contains definition of terms, such as cout.
* Final output of compiler is executable or object code ot machine code, which a computer a run or execute on demand.
* IDE is Integrated/Interactive Development Environment is a editor with all features to build, run, scan, spellchek used by many software professionals.
* #include directive instructs the computer to make available (to include) facilities from ****.h or within <> angle brackets.
* Library is some code written by other developers that we access using #include ***.h.
* Linker takes care of linking of compiled object code units to form a executable. A program usally consists of several units, often developed by different people, for example \'Hello World!\' program plus the std library, these two separate parts must be compiled and the resulting object codes linked together to form an executable file/program.
* Main is a special function, every c++ executable program must have, to tell it where to start executing.
* Object code is output of compilation process for Linux and Unix systems.
* An output is a result of any program, often expected after running the program.
* To get computer to do something, someone or you must have to tell it exactly what to do in a way that computer can understand, such a description is call program.
* Source code a program text unit which a compiler can understand usally its a human redable code.
* A part of program that specifies an action is called a statement.
* An Object is a region of memory with a type that specifies what kind of information can be placed in it.
* A Variable is a named Object.
* A statement that introduces a new name in to a program and sets aside memory for a variable is called definition.
* The data item that goes in to variable is called as value.
